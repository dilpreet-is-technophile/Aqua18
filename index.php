According to the facts, 85% of water needs in India are met through groundwater. Of course facts also claim that our groundwater is at the verge of replenishment. If everything goes as it is going now then we will definitely lose all our underground water by 2021. To ensure that we don`t face problem of water crisis in coming future, our company came up with a promising solution. It is obvious that we cannot recharge our water table by taps only rain can pump it`s level.So nothing can be better than rainwater harvesting. Also planting a rainwater harvesting setup is not that much easy as it seems, one has to hustle with many indexes and complications. </p> </div> <div class="banner-content col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-4"> <img class="img1" src="img\vector.png"> </div> </div></div> <div class="container-fluid service-area" id="service"><div class="row d-flex justify-content-center"><div class="col-md-8 pb-40 header-text"><h1>Services</h1></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-2 col-md-6"></div><div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6"><div class="service1"><h4><span class="lnr lnr-user"></span>Under Construction Houses</h4><div class="accordion" id="accordionExample"> <div class="card-header" id="headingOne"> <h2 class="mb-0" style="text-align:center"><button class="btn" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseOne" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseOne" style="background-image:linear-gradient(to left,#f2f2f2,#f2f2f2);background-color:#000000!important;background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.4)!important;color:white;padding:10px"> Know more.. </button> </h2> </div> <div id="collapseOne" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingOne" data-parent="#accordionExample"> <div class="card-body" style="background-color:#000000!important;background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.4)!important;color:white;padding:10px;text-align:center">Aqua 18 is dedicated to provide outstanding and economical solution for rainwater harvesting in under construction houses. We dig a tank of 6ftx6ftx6ft on ground and then the a 4-inchboreis made into the ground which goes at least upto 80 ft in the ground and then best quality pvc pipes are fitted into it. After that pvc pipes are drawn from the rooftop and connected to tankvia a filter. Now the filtered water is allowed to enter the tank and via tank the water enters pipe through small holes made on pipe after getting ultra-filtered and hence the water seeps down into the MOTHER EARTH.This process costs around 25000-30000 depending upon the area dug, material used and as specified by customers. So the customers get a great deal as they can buy lives of their future generations in just a few thousands. </div> </div> </div></div></div><div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6"><div class="service2"><h4><span class="lnr lnr-license"></span>Fully Furnished Houses</h4><div class="accordion" id="accordionExample"> <div class="card-header" id="headingTwo"><h2 class="mb-0" style="text-align:center"> <button class="btn" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseTwo" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseTwo" style="background-image:linear-gradient(to left,#f2f2f2,#f2f2f2);background-color:#000000!important;background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.4)!important;color:white;padding:10px">Know more.. </button></h2> </div> <div id="collapseTwo" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingTwo" data-parent="#accordionExample"><div class="card-body" style="background-color:#000000!important;background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.4)!important;color:white;padding:10px;text-align:center">Opening the water FD at fully furnished houses begins with selecting the perfect spot from where water can drip into the ground. If the owners of houses can select the right dripping area then it's fine, but if they are facing problem in doing so then our executive will visit the house and help in detecting the dripping area. No fees or any other type of allowances are charged for this visit and area selection. After the spot has been selected the very first step is digging a tank of dimension 6ft6ft. Then a bore of 80foot is made so as to connect tank with ground water. The bore is then provided by the casing of PVC pipes. The tank is further cemented so as to increase its durability and functionality. The tank is then covered to restrict fusion of impurities with water. To ensure purity of water a dedicated filter is installed on tank, each and every single drop entering the tank has to penetrate through this filter. Finally, the tank is connected with roof of house through filtered PVC pipes. The altered beauty of house is then re-achieved by rebuilding all the wear and tear done to the house. So the Rain Water Harvesting setup to save the holy ELIXIR and the most precious asset is ready.</div> </div></div></div></div><div class="col-lg-2 col-md-6"></div><div class="col-lg-2 col-md-6"></div><div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6"><div class="service3"><h4><span class="lnr lnr-license"></span>Commercial Buildings</h4><div class="accordion" id="accordionExample"> <div class="card-header" id="headingThree"><h2 class="mb-0" style="text-align:center"> <button class="btn" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseThree" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseThree" style="background-image:linear-gradient(to left,#f2f2f2,#f2f2f2);background-color:#000000!important;background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.4)!important;color:white;padding:10px">Know more.. </button></h2> </div> <div id="collapseThree" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingThree" data-parent="#accordionExample"><div class="card-body" style="background-color:#000000!important;background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.4)!important;color:white;padding:10px;text-align:center">Rainwater harvesting in a commercial building is a super awesome deal because a building alonein rain rich areas can single handedly save upto millions of litres of water in a single year.The process of setting up a rainwater harvesting unit in a commercial building can be very beneficialand the team of Aqua 18 makes it an easy task.A tank of your desired dimensions(generally 6ftx6ftx6ft) is made into the ground and a bore of 80ftis made into the earth.
